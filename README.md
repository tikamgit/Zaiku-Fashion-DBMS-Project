ZAIKU FASHION
ONLINE RETAIL STORE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS

Zaiku Fashion is proud to present its online retail store, catering to the modern shopper's needs. In the development of our web application for an online shopping portal, we prioritize a seamless and user-friendly experience. Users can effortlessly find clothing suitable for their occasions, aligning with their dress code. Our app eliminates the need for time-consuming in-store shopping, offering a diverse range of options conveniently accessible at their fingertips.

Upon opening the app, users are prompted to log in by entering their email and password, creating a personalized account. Following this, users input essential personal information such as gender, name, phone number, and address. Once completed, users are directed to the main store, where they can easily search for specific clothing items tailored to various demographics, including kids, women, and men. The straightforward process involves selecting desired items, adding them to the cart, and proceeding to purchase.

Upon clicking the "Buy" option, users finalize their order by entering the delivery address, with the flexibility to change it if needed. Payment options include cash on delivery, Google Pay, among others. After successful payment, the order is confirmed, providing a seamless online shopping experience.

Vendors will also be present in app for taking the orders of the clothes that are going to be out of stock . They will not be allowed to have access to the information of the customers. They will have their own login ids and password .
